# GeoZarr examples

## About

This repository contains examples and documentation for working with GeoZarr-compliant Zarr stores.

The **Python library** (`geozarr-examples`) that was originally developed here has moved to [geozarr-toolkit](https://github.com/zarr-developers/geozarr-toolkit). Please use `geozarr-toolkit` for creating and validating GeoZarr-compliant metadata going forward.

More information is available in the [GeoZarr examples website](https://developmentseed.org/geozarr-examples/).

## Overview

[GeoZarr examples](https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples) provides a Python library and examples for working with GeoZarr-compliant Zarr stores. The library implements the new modular Zarr conventions:

- **[spatial:](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/spatial)** - Spatial coordinate and transformation information
- **[proj:](https://github.com/zarr-experimental/geo-proj)** - Coordinate Reference System (CRS) information
- **[multiscales](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/multiscales)** - Multiscale pyramid layout

## Python Library

Install the library to create and validate GeoZarr-compliant metadata:

```bash
pip install "geozarr-examples @ git+https://github.com/developmentseed/geozarr-examples.git"
```

Quick example:

```python
from geozarr_examples import create_geozarr_attrs

attrs = create_geozarr_attrs(
    dimensions=["Y", "X"],
    crs="EPSG:32633",
    transform=[10.0, 0.0, 500000.0, 0.0, -10.0, 5000000.0],
)
```

See the [Getting Started guide](getting-started.qmd) for more details, or browse the [API Reference](api/index.qmd).

## Goals

- Demonstrate how to write GeoZarr compliant data.
    - Provide a demonstration of writing CRS information.
    - Provide a demonstration of writing bounding box information.
    - Provide a demonstration of writing multiscale data.
    - Provide a demonstration of writing multi-scale data conforming to a specific well-known tile matrix set (TMS)
    - Provide a demonstration of storing raw data in NetCDF and overviews in native Zarr, with a virtual GeoZarr compliant entrypoint.
- Demonstrate how to read GeoZarr compliant data.
    - Provide a demonstration of reading in GeoZarr data with raw data in "native" zarr.
    - Provide a demonstration of reading in GeoZarr data with raw data and overviews in "native" zarr.
    - Provide a demonstration of reading in GeoZarr data with raw data in archival formats and overviews in "native" zarr via a single virtual GeoZarr compliant entrypoint.
- Demonstrate how to work with GeoZarr data in Xarray using flexible coordinates and the xproj extension.
- Demonstrate how to work with GeoZarr data in OpenLayers.
- Demonstrate how to work with GeoZarr data in GDAL.

## Feedback cadence

We will provide progress and solicit community feedback during the following events:

## FAQ

### What's the status of GeoZarr?

GeoZarr is currently being developed as an [Open Geospatial Consortium Standard](https://www.ogc.org/announcement/ogc-forms-new-geozarr-standards-working-group-to-establish-a-zarr-encoding-for-geospatial-data/).
There is a [GeoZarr Standards Working Group](https://portal.ogc.org/index.php?m=public&orderby=default&tab=7) that meets once a month. We now have
experimental prototypes of [all](https://github.com/pydata/xarray/pull/9543) [of](https://github.com/zarr-developers/VirtualiZarr/pull/271) [the](https://xproj.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html)
[pieces](https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-3-release/) to move GeoZarr out of a discussion phase and into a demonstration phase. This repository stems from the hope that building demonstrations will lead to
adoption, iteration, and formalization of a stable GeoZarr specification.

### What's the new approach for GeoZarr conventions?

GeoZarr has shifted from a complex, abstract model (CDM) to a collection of simple, composable Zarr Conventions that directly address developer needs. This incremental, feature-driven strategy delivers immediate value and builds momentum. The [Zarr Conventions Framework](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/zarr-conventions-spec) provides the mechanism for communities (e.g., geospatial, bioimaging) to register and share metadata conventions within Zarr using a `zarr_conventions` attribute that points to a convention's spec URL, schema, or UUID.

### What tools support GeoZarr conventions?

GeoZarr conventions are gaining adoption across the ecosystem:

- **OpenLayers**: Initial PR submitted for Multiscales support
- **TiTiler**: Already compliant with Multiscales
- **GDAL**: Read-only support for Multiscales and proj: conventions funded and in development
- **EOPF Explorer V1 (ESA)**: Uses Zarr conventions as a foundational component
- **ZarrLayer (CarbonPlan)**: Experimenting with Multiscales and proj:
- **QGIS**: Plugin in development for direct GeoZarr data analysis

### What is the relationship between GeoZarr and CF conventions?

Zarr has a 10-year history of successful, informal use with CF (Climate and Forecast) data. The primary challenge is formalizing existing patterns, not creating new ones. The GeoZarr community is working on a proposal to formalize CF-on-Zarr patterns to ensure that GeoZarr serves both the GIS world and critical climate/weather data use cases. The [CF convention](examples/cf/) for Zarr uses unprefixed attribute names (`standard_name`, `units`, etc.) for backwards compatibility with existing CF-compliant datasets and libraries like cf-python and xarray.

### How does Zarr Specification V3 spec influence GeoZarr?

The GeoZarr conventions are designed to work with both Zarr format 2 and Zarr format 3. The convention metadata content (`spatial:`, `proj:`, `multiscales`) is identical regardless of Zarr version - only the storage location differs (`.zattrs` files in V2 vs `attributes` in `zarr.json` for V3). Best practices may be impacted by new features available in Zarr specification version 3 (e.g., sharding).

### How does the release of Zarr-Python 3 influence GeoZarr?

The Zarr-Python 3 release will help GeoZarr users through its increased performance, modernized codebase, and support for extensions. But, it only really interacts with the GeoZarr spec in-so-far
as Zarr-Python 3 supports Zarr specification V3 (see prior question on "How does Zarr Specification V3 spec influence GeoZarr").

### Where can I discuss GeoZarr?

OGC has dissolved its Google Groups. The primary communication channels are now:

- **CNG Slack**: [#geozarr channel](https://cloudnativegeo.slack.com/)
- **OGC Agora**: The official OGC discussion platform

### What is the relationship between GeoZarr and Web-Optimized-Zarr?

Please see the [web-optimized Zarr overview page](web-optimized-zarr.qmd).

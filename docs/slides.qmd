## Goals {footer=false}

- Reinvigorate Building It Out!
    - üôÖ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüí≠ All benefits from discussion are finished
    - üöÄ GeoZarr can be successful if we act now
    - üíî GeoZarr can fail if we don't

## What is Zarr? {footer=false}

An community developed, open-source format for the storage of chunked, compressed, N-dimensional arrays

- Cloud optimized (concurrent read/writes, "infinitely" scalable)
- Cross-disciplinary (originally developed for bio-imaging)
- *Extremely* extensible (supports any key-value store)

## What's going on today?

- Zarr is growing in popularity
- Icechunk is improving consistency and performance
- VirtualiZarr is simplifying virtualization
- Progressing towards Zarr specification V3 across languages

## Zarr implementation landscape

- [Independently implemented across languages](https://zarr.dev/implementations/)
    - Zarr Python 3.0 [released in January](https://zarr.dev/blog/zarr-python-3-release/)
    - Even Rouault is updating [GDAL's Zarr driver](https://gdal.org/en/stable/drivers/raster/zarr.html)
    - Lachlan Deakin is [updating the Zarrs Rust library](https://github.com/LDeakin/zarrs)
    - Trevor Manz was (is?) trying to consolidate the JavaScript implementations (unaware of format 3 status)
    - Unidata has build [Zarr support into the NetCDF C library](https://docs.unidata.ucar.edu/nug/current/nczarr_head.html) (unaware of format 3 status)
    - OpenScapes is coordinating R support (will rely on GDAL driver)
    - Unaware of [Julia lang's](https://github.com/JuliaIO/Zarr.jl) progress towards Zarr format 3

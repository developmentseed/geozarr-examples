    "section": "FAQ",
    "text": "FAQ\n\nWhat‚Äôs the status of GeoZarr?\nGeoZarr is currently being developed as a Open Geospatial Consortium Standard. There is a GeoZarr Standards Working Group that meets once a month. We now have experimental prototypes of all of the pieces to move GeoZarr out of a discussion phase and into a demonstration phase. This repository stems from the hope that building demonstrations will lead to adoption, iteration, and formalization of a stable GeoZarr specification.\n\n\nHow does Zarr Specification V3 spec influence GeoZarr?\nThe GeoZarr spec is designed for Zarr specification version 2. This repository will demonstrate how the differences between Zarr format 2 and Zarr format 3 would influence GeoZarr. My expectation is that there is not much difference in the metadata requirements between the two formats. However, best practices will likely be impacted by new features available in Zarr specification version 3 (e.g., sharding).\n\n\nHow does the release of Zarr-Python 3 influence GeoZarr?\nThe Zarr-Python 3 release will help GeoZarr users through its increased performance, modernized codebase, and support for extensions. But, it only really interacts with the GeoZarr spec in-so-far as Zarr-Python 3 supports Zarr specification V3 (see prior question on ‚ÄúHow does Zarr Specification V3 spec influence GeoZarr‚Äù).\n\n\nWhat is the relationship between GeoZarr and Web-Optimized-Zarr?\nWeb-Optimized Zarr right now is just an idea. I hope that the term ‚Äúweb-optimized zarr‚Äù will promote the use of overviews in GeoZarr (which are optional in the core spec) and familiarize practitioners with the concept of storing full-resolution ‚Äúarchival‚Äù versions in other file formats and reduced resolution versions in ‚Äúnative‚Äù zarr. GeoZarr would allow a single ‚Äúweb-optimized‚Äù entrypoint to both via virtualization. A prototype will part of this repository."
